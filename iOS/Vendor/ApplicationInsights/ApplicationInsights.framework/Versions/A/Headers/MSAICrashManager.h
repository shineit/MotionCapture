/**
The crash reporting module.

This is the Application Insights module for handling crash reports, including when distributed via the App Store.
As a foundation it is using the open source, reliable and async-safe crash reporting framework
[PLCrashReporter](https://code.google.com/p/plcrashreporter/).

This module works as a wrapper around the underlying crash reporting framework and provides functionality to
detect new crashes.

It also provides options via `MSAICrashManagerDelegate` protocol and a way to detect startup crashes so you
can adjust your startup process to get these crash reports too and delay your app initialization.

Crashes are send the next time the app starts. This module is not sending the reports right when the crash happens
deliberately, because if is not safe to implement such a mechanism while being async-safe (any Objective-C code
is _NOT_ async-safe!) and not causing more danger like a deadlock of the device, than helping. We found that users
do start the app again because most don't know what happened, and you will get by far most of the reports.

Sending the reports on startup is done asynchronously (non-blocking). This is the only safe way to ensure
that the app won't be possibly killed by the iOS watchdog process, because startup could take too long
and the app could not react to any user input when network conditions are bad or connectivity might be
very slow.

It is possible to check upon startup if the app crashed before using `didCrashInLastSession` and also how much
time passed between the app launch and the crash using `timeintervalCrashInLastSessionOccured`. This allows you
to add additional code to your app delaying the app start until the crash has been successfully send if the crash
occured within a critical startup timeframe, e.g. after 10 seconds. The `MSAICrashManagerDelegate` protocol provides
various delegates to inform the app about it's current status so you can continue the remaining app startup setup
after sending has been completed. The documentation contains a guide
[How to handle Crashes on startup](HowTo-Handle-Crashes-On-Startup) with an example on how to do that.

More background information on this topic can be found in the following blog post by Landon Fuller, the
developer of [PLCrashReporter](https://www.plcrashreporter.org), about writing reliable and
safe crash reporting: [Reliable Crash Reporting](http://goo.gl/WvTBR)

@warning If you start the app with the Xcode debugger attached, detecting crashes will _NOT_ be enabled!

/**
*  EXPERIMENTAL: Enable heuristics to detect the app not terminating cleanly
*
*  This allows it to get a crash report if the app got killed while being in the foreground
*  because of now of the following reasons:
*  - The main thread was blocked for too long
*  - The app took too long to start up
*  - The app tried to allocate too much memory. If iOS did send a memory warning before killing the app because of this reason, `didReceiveMemoryWarningInLastSession` returns `YES`.
*  - Permitted background duration if main thread is running in an endless loop
*  - App failed to resume in time if main thread is running in an endless loop
*  - If `enableMachExceptionHandler` is not activated, crashed due to stackoverflow will also be reported
*
*  The following kills can _NOT_ be detected:
*  - Terminating the app takes too long
*  - Permitted background duration too long for all other cases
*  - App failed to resume in time for all other cases
*  - possibly more cases
*
*  Crash reports triggered by this mechanisms do _NOT_ contain any stack traces since the time of the kill
*  cannot be intercepted and hence no stack trace of the time of the kill event can't be gathered.
*
*  The heuristic is implemented as follows:
*  If the app never gets a `UIApplicationDidEnterBackgroundNotification` or `UIApplicationWillTerminateNotification`
*  notification, PLCrashReporter doesn't detect a crash itself, and the app starts up again, it is assumed that
*  the app got either killed by iOS while being in foreground or a crash occured that couldn't be detected.
*
*  Default: _NO_
*
* @warning This is a heuristic and it _MAY_ report false positives! It has been tested with iOS 6.1 and iOS 7.
* Depending on Apple changing notification events, new iOS version may cause more false positives!

/**
* Set the callbacks that will be executed prior to program termination after a crash has occurred
*
* PLCrashReporter provides support for executing an application specified function in the context
* of the crash reporter's signal handler, after the crash report has been written to disk.
*
* Writing code intended for execution inside of a signal handler is exceptionally difficult, and is _NOT_ recommended!
*
* _Program Flow and Signal Handlers_
*
* When the signal handler is called the normal flow of the program is interrupted, and your program is an unknown state. Locks may be held, the heap may be corrupt (or in the process of being updated), and your signal handler may invoke a function that was being executed at the time of the signal. This may result in deadlocks, data corruption, and program termination.
*
* _Async-Safe Functions_
*
* A subset of functions are defined to be async-safe by the OS, and are safely callable from within a signal handler. If you do implement a custom post-crash handler, it must be async-safe. A table of POSIX-defined async-safe functions and additional information is available from the [CERT programming guide - SIG30-C](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/SIG30-C.+Call+only+asynchronous-safe+functions+within+signal+handlers).
*
* Most notably, the Objective-C runtime itself is not async-safe, and Objective-C may not be used within a signal handler.
